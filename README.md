# Data-Pre-processing-EDA-Feature-Engineering
This repository is about how to do data pre-processing, how to perform EDA and how to do perform feature engineering on BigMart sale data.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ðŸ‘‰ BigMart's data scientists gathered 2013 sales data for 1559 commodities across ten locations in many cities. Additionally, certain characteristics of each product and retailer have been determined.
ðŸ‘‰ Data pre-processing and feature engineering will be performed to prepare the dataset before it is used by the machine learning model.

ðŸ“Œ This notebook aims to:
âœ… Perform initial data exploration.
âœ… Perform data pre-processing.
âœ… Perform EDA on cleaned data set.
âœ… Perform feature engineering (one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binning).

# Data Set Description ðŸ§¾

ðŸ‘‰ There are 12 variables in this data set:
5 categorical variables,
5 continuous variables,
1 variable to accommodate the Item identifier (ID), and
